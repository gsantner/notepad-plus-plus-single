# Notepad++ Single

Simple wrapper for [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) which forwards parameters 
including additional switches to get an advanced "notepad" like editor without tabs and session remembering for openened files.
I personally register e.g. **.txt** files to open with the executable, so it just opens a single editor window.
